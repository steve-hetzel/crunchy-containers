== Description

pgbackrest is a utility that performs a backup, restore, and archive
function for a PostgreSQL database. pgbackrest is written and
maintained by David Steele, and more information can be found on the
official website.

http://www.pgbackrest.org/

New functionality for pgbackrest was added into the Crunchy Container Suite as of version 1.3.1.
Backups are currently performed by manually executing pgbackrest commands against the desired pod.
Restores can now be performed via a new crunchy-backrest-restore container, which offers FULL or
DELTA restore capability.

This document will discuss the design and usage of the pgbackrest features
as implemented so far.

=== pgbackrest Configuration

pgbackrest is configured using a `pgbackrest.conf` file that is
mounted into the crunchy-postgres container at `/pgconf`.

If you place a `pgbackrest.conf` file within this mounted directory, it
will trigger the use of pgbackrest within the PostgreSQL container
as the `archive_command` and will turn on the `archive_mode` to begin
archival.  It is still required to define the `ARCHIVE_TIMEOUT` environment
variable within your container configuration as it is set to
a disable value of 0 by default.

The following changes will be made to the container's `postgresql.conf`
file:
....
ARCHIVE_MODE=on
ARCHIVE_TIMEOUT=60
ARCHIVE_COMMAND='pgbackrest --stanza=db archive-push %p'
....

If you are using a crunchy-postgres image older than 1.7.1, `archive_command` must specify where
the `pgbackrest.conf` file is located:

....
ARCHIVE_COMMAND='pgbackrest --config=/pgconf/pgbackrest.conf --stanza=db archive-push %p'
....

This requires you use a pgbackrest stanza name of *db* within the
`pgbackrest.conf` file you mount.

When set, WAL files generated by the database will be written
out to the `/backrestrepo` mount point.

=== Performing a Backup

Examples for pgbackrest have been created within the standalone and Kubernetes/OpenShift
directories.

Once you configure the crunchy-postgres container to use pgbackrest, you
will perform a backup using the following commands:
....
docker exec -it backrest bash
/usr/bin/pgbackrest --stanza=db backup
....

Examine the contents of the mounted `/backrestrepo` directory to
see the archive files and also the backup files.

=== Running the Examples

==== Kubernetes and OpenShift

NOTE: The examples work on both Kubernetes and OpenShift.  Set the `CCP_CLI` environment variable
to the correct binary for your environment.

....
# Kubernetes
export CCP_CLI=kubectl

# OpenShift
export CCP_CLI=oc
....

Start the example as follows:

....
cd $CCPROOT/examples/kube/backrest
./run.sh
....

This will create the following in your Kubernetes environment:

 * configMap named backrest-restore-pgconf which contains the pgbackrest.conf file
 * backrest pod with pgbackrest archive enabled and an initial stanza db created on initialization
 * backrest service
 * backrest-restore-pgdata PVC which is used for `/pgdata`
 * backrest-restore-backrestrepo PVC which is used for `/backrestrepo`

Examine the `/backrestrepo` location to view the archive directory and ensure WAL archiving is working.

==== Manual Backup

You can create a backup using backrest using this command within
the container:

....
pgbackrest --stanza=db backup
....

=== Performing a Restore

There are two options to choose from when performing a restore, DELTA and FULL. A FULL is the default; a DELTA will only occur if the environment variable DELTA is specified in the restore-job spec. Consult the pgbackrest user guide to determine which is best suited to run.

Steps for FULL restore

 * Delete the backrest pod, if still running using
 * Empty the PGDATA directory (remove all files)
 * Navigate to the backrest-restore examples directory. Execute the `full-restore.sh` script.
 * Check the restore logs for the container to verify success. You can also view the logs of the completed job pod with `${CCP_CLI} get pod -a`
 * Re-create the backrest pod in the backrest examples directory. The database will recover.

Steps for DELTA restore

 * Delete the backrest pod, if still running
 * rm postmaster.pid from PGDATA.
 * Navigate to the backrest-restore examples directory. Execute the `delta-restore.sh` script.
 * Check the restore logs for the container to verify success. You can also view the logs of the completed job pod with `${CCP_CLI} get pod -a`
 * Re-create the backrest pod in the backrest examples directory. The database will recover only files that have changed from the last backup.
